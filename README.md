# ML-Project-Chronic kidney Disease Prediction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the body. This can lead to a buildup of harmful substances, potentially resulting in serious health complications if left untreated.
• Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful tool for predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) by identifying patterns in complex medical data.
• Popular ML techniques for CKD prediction include Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
• Python is a widely-used programming language for ML, with robust libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Kerasthat provide easy-to-use APIs for building and training ML models.
